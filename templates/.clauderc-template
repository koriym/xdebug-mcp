# .clauderc - Claude AI Configuration Template for PHP Projects

project_name: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
project_type: php_application
description: "Brief description of your PHP project"

# Essential context files for AI to understand the project
context:
  - CLAUDE.md                    # AI instructions and debugging principles
  - README.md                    # Project overview
  - composer.json                # Dependencies and configuration
  # Add your key files:
  # - src/main.php
  # - config/app.php

# Critical rules for AI behavior in this project
rules:
  debugging:
    - "NEVER suggest var_dump(), print_r(), or echo for debugging"
    - "ALWAYS use trace-based debugging with Xdebug"
    - "Use XDEBUG_TRIGGER=TRACE php -dxdebug.mode=trace file.php"
    - "Analyze trace files for debugging insights instead of code modification"
  
  trace_files:
    - "Use /tmp directory for trace outputs"
    - "Trace files contain execution flow, variable values, performance data"
  
  # Add project-specific rules:
  # code_style:
  #   - "Use PSR-12 coding standards"
  #   - "Prefer dependency injection over global variables"

# Known technical issues and their solutions
known_issues:
  # Add your project-specific issues:
  # database_connection:
  #   problem: "Connection timeouts in production"
  #   solution: "Use connection pooling with retry logic"
  
  xdebug_setup:
    problem: "Xdebug not configured for trace mode"
    solution: "Add xdebug.mode=trace to php.ini or use -d flags"

# Project-specific workflows
workflows:
  debugging:
    command: "XDEBUG_TRIGGER=TRACE php -dxdebug.mode=trace target_file.php"
    analysis: "Read generated trace file in /tmp/"
    focus: "Execution flow, variable states, performance"
  
  # Add your workflows:
  # testing:
  #   command: "vendor/bin/phpunit"
  #   coverage: "vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/"

# AI behavior preferences
preferences:
  response_style: "concise_technical"
  debugging_approach: "trace_based_non_invasive" 
  code_analysis: "runtime_data_preferred"

# Project-specific notes
notes:
  # Add important project context:
  # - "Database schema changes require migration scripts"
  # - "API endpoints follow REST conventions"
  # - "Frontend uses jQuery 3.x"
